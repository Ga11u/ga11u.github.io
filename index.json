Before choosing which strategy to follow for upgrading, we have to asks ourselves some questions:\n Is okay for us to have some downtime in our service? Can we stop our services and for how long? Is there any data compromised which need to be saved and restored? Do we really need to updrage our infrastructure? Is there any security risk in doing so? Do we have the necessary resources?  In this article we will deal with the scenario where we can have some downtime and there is data that need to be saved and restored.\nIn our scenario we start with 11 instances running in a OpenStack cloud provider, with the following configuration:\n 3 x m1.medium instances (1 VCPUs + 4GB RAM) 6 x m1.large instances (2 VCPUs + 8GB RAM) 2 x m1.xlarge instances (4 VCPUs + 16GB RAM) 6 x 80GB disk  We have a Docker Swarm platform running in all instances with services to run real-time processes, 3 Apache Cassandra nodes, 3 Blazegraph nodes, 3 Zookeeper nodes, 3 Kafka nodes, a Mongo DB and other services.\nWe want to upgrade our infrastructure to:\n 4 x m1.medium instances (1 VCPUs + 4GB RAM) 9 x m1.large instances (2 VCPUs + 8GB RAM) 4 x m1.xlarge instances (4 VCPUs + 16GB RAM) 3 x 3TB disk 1 x 11TB disk  The Apache Cassandra and Blazegraph data need to be migrated to the new disks and all services will have to start running again with the minimun downtime possible.\nTo do so, we will make use of Terraform, to modify the previous configuration with the need requirments and create volume disks snaptshots for migrating our data. Then, with Ansible we will mount the new volumes with the migrated data and install the Docker Swarm platform again.\nCreating voume disks snaptshots First, we need to backup our data. To do so, we can either use an external service such as Google Cloud Storage or use the OpenStack\u0026rsquo;s volume snaptshots. In any case, my advice is to stop the services running in the instances where you have the data to avoid any data corruption during the process.\nIn our cause, we are going to create volume snapshots with OpenStack and rememeber the snapshot ID, which will be needed leter with Terraform configuration.\n\rAlthough this is the first step, if you are working in a real-time environment I recommend to do it at the end before you run Terraform, to minimaice the data loss during the downtime.\r\r\rAs our platform is using Swarm to orquestrate docker containers, we don\u0026rsquo;t have an option to stop a running container as it is with docker-compose or stand-alone containers. Thus, we will have to remove the running service to stop it:\ndocker service rm \u0026lt;service-name\u0026gt;  The removing process of a service may take sometime, thus it is important to verify that the manager have removed the service:\ndocker service inspect \u0026lt;service-name\u0026gt;  As well as, to verify that the service was removed from the node where it was running:\ndocker ps  If the service does not appear, then we can be sure that we successfuly removed the service and we can process to create a spanshot.\nOnce the service has been removed, we can proceed to detach the volume from the instance and create the snapshot. This process can be done manually from the OpenStack Dashboard or CLI. When detaching the volume from the instance, the status of the volum should appear as Available instead of In-use. The snapshot cam be created with attached volumes too, however doing a snapshot with a detached volume is safer and recomended for our purpose.\n\rIt is not possible to delete the old volumes, because they have an assigned snapshot. To delete them, first we have to delete the snapshots. This process, should be done at the end, once we have verified that our data migration succeded.\r\r\rUpadating Terraform files The Terraform files configuration should be updated to reflect our desired newer configuration.\nThe flavors type and the amount of instances for each type can be updated like this, where we map the type of instance to their characteristics and numbers.\nflavor_name = { \u0026quot;manager\u0026quot; = \u0026quot;m1.medium\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;cassandra\u0026quot; = \u0026quot;m1.large\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;blazegraph\u0026quot; = \u0026quot;m1.xlarge\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;worker\u0026quot; = \u0026quot;m1.large\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;hpc-worker\u0026quot; = \u0026quot;m1.xlarge\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;mongo\u0026quot; = \u0026quot;m1.medium\u0026quot;, \u0026quot;zookafka\u0026quot; = \u0026quot;m1.large\u0026quot; } instance_count = { \u0026quot;manager\u0026quot; = 3, \u0026quot;cassandra\u0026quot; = 3, \u0026quot;blazegraph\u0026quot; = 1, \u0026quot;worker\u0026quot; = 3, \u0026quot;hpc-worker\u0026quot; = 3, \u0026quot;mongo\u0026quot; = 1, \u0026quot;zookafka\u0026quot; = 3 }  The image used in the instances can be updated to a newer version. It is important to check the image version since the images can be outdated or unavailable. To look for updated and available images:\nopenstack image list --status active  To update the terraform file with the desired image, use the Image ID instead of the image name to ensure that you always use the same image:\nimage_id = { \u0026quot;Ubuntu20.04LTS\u0026quot; = \u0026quot;7085d64d-f591-4a23-bdfe-dbbd1288afcf\u0026quot; }  To create new instances, we have to define new resources. In that case, we are creating a new hpc-worker instance using the previous maped values. The count key is used to create multple instances according to our previous declared variable instance_count, and the same apply for the other variables mapings (var.). The count.index is used to extract the index of each instance [0,1,2 \u0026hellip; n) and generate a name like hpc-worker-0 for the first instance.\nresource \u0026quot;openstack_compute_instance_v2\u0026quot; \u0026quot;hpc-worker\u0026quot; { count = var.instance_count[\u0026quot;hpc-worker\u0026quot;] name = \u0026quot;${var.node_name[\u0026quot;hpc-worker\u0026quot;]}-${count.index}\u0026quot; image_id = var.image_id[var.image_name[\u0026quot;image\u0026quot;]] flavor_name = var.flavor_name[\u0026quot;hpc-worker\u0026quot;] key_pair = var.key_pub security_groups = var.security_group network { name = var.network } metadata = { ssh_user = var.role_ssh_user[\u0026quot;hpc-worker\u0026quot;], prefer_ipv6 = false, my_server_role = var.node_name[\u0026quot;hpc-worker\u0026quot;], python_bin = \u0026quot;/usr/bin/python3\u0026quot; } }  To create a 3TB volume using the previous volume snapshot, so the data will be migrated to the new volume. Thus, we need to indicate the snapshot_id which we want to use. If the snpashot is smaller than the new volume, we will need to expand the volume later, otherwise our instance will not use the full volume capacity. To attach the volume to the new instance, we need to provide the instance_id where we want to attach the volume and the volum_id to attach.\nresource \u0026quot;openstack_blockstorage_volume_v3\u0026quot; \u0026quot;volume_cassandra_1\u0026quot; { name = \u0026quot;${var.volume_name}-cassandra-1\u0026quot; size = 3000 snapshot_id = \u0026quot;f2714817-f9f8-42f3-aa7c-363d7b887983\u0026quot; } resource \u0026quot;openstack_compute_volume_attach_v2\u0026quot; \u0026quot;attach_cassandra_volume_0_to_db_instances\u0026quot; { instance_id = openstack_compute_instance_v2.cassandra[1].id volume_id = openstack_blockstorage_volume_v3.volume_cassandra_1.id }  Upgrading our infrastrcutre with Terraform Once we have defined our desired infrastructure, we can start with the deployment:\nterraform plan terraform apply  Mounting, expanding disks and ploying Docker Swarm with Ansible  mkdir -p /mnt/data sudo mount /dev/sdb /mnt/data xfs_growfs /dev/sdb  ","date":1599130432,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1599130432,"objectID":"7b5d2fd2235f3bbf8666cf55a7f0c3c1","permalink":"https://ga11u.github.io/post/upgrading-cloud-platform-with-terraform/","publishdate":"2020-09-03T12:53:52+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/upgrading-cloud-platform-with-terraform/","section":"post","summary":"Upgrading a running cloud infrastructure is a critical task that have to planned carefully in advance.

Even though it is presented as an ultra high-performance graph database and designed to scale-out, the scale-out feature has not been that much supported as developers would wish.\nAt the beginning (from the 2.0.0 release), the scale-out was moved to a Enterprise fueture under licence supriptions, as we can see from the following information about High Availability (HA) and Scale-out features in the Blazegraph Blog (https://blog.blazegraph.com/):\n Enterprise Features (HA and Scale-out)\nStarting in release 2.0.0, the Scale-out and HA capabilities are moved to Enterprise features. These are available to uses with support and/or license subscription. If you are an existing GPLv2 user of these features, we have some easy ways to migrate. Contact us for more information. We’d like to make it as easy as possible.\n Later, the support for High Availability was droped out from the project, due to the lack of open source community, as it is corroborated by Bryan Thompson (@thompsonbry), the Chief Scientist and founder of SYSTAP and one of the contributors of Blazegraph, in the issue #116 at Blazegraph/database GitHub (https://github.com/blazegraph/database/issues/116):\n The HA configuration is not functional in more recent releases. Systap halted development of the Blazegraph HA feature several years ago (long before we came to Amazon). Full HA is a complex thing to develop and maintain with master failure, testing of the various failover configurations, longevity testing, targeted failure mode tests, etc. We self-funded quite a bit, but we did not get the engagement from the open source community to make it worth while to continue HA as an open source feature.\nYou can always do the poor man\u0026rsquo;s HA, put the updates onto a durable queue, and then apply writes to each server in parallel. You would need to handle master failover of course. Or you can capture the IChangeLog from one server and replicate the post-facto changes (in terms of statements added and removed) to the other servers, again using a durable queue to capture the post-commit change set. To do the latter, you would also need to report additions to the dictionary indices (which is not currently done, but which would not be that difficult to add in the LexiconRelation and an apply loop interface for the replicas to apply the deltas on their local indices). I think this might \u0026ldquo;just work\u0026rdquo;. The local journal tracks the transactions in flight and manages the recycling of deleted records once no transaction can read on those records. So transactional access to data should \u0026ldquo;work\u0026rdquo; on the replicas without doing anything else. Again, you would need to handle master failover, etc.\nThanks, Bryan\n Currently, since Blazegraph was taken over by Amazon (Neptune AWS2), the project does not seem to be activly maintained. However, it is possible to scale-out Blazegraph and configure with HA clusters.\nThe Blazegraph scale-out architecture (Figure 1) is based on a shared disk volume where all Blazegraph\u0026rsquo;s nodes have access to the data. This shared disck volume can be set-up accross different machines, racks or regions with servies like Gluster. A load balancer distributes the data requests and updates between the Blazegraph\u0026rsquo;s nodes and Zookeeper manages the services running on each node.\n\rBlazegraph scale-out architecture\r\r\rThe Blazegraph scale-out architecture provides with horisontal scaling as both nodes an disks space can be extended. However, this architecture does not provide of distributed data along each node, as it would be the case of Apache Cassandra3.\nDue to the lack of documentation and support for clustered and HA Blazegraph deployment, the scale-out option is only for those fearless adventurers who wants to try out the clustered and HA version of Blazegraph. A guide about how to deploy the clustered configuration can be found at https://github.com/blazegraph/database/wiki/ClusterGuide with the following advice: We recommend that you ask for help when attempting your first cluster install!, the HA configuration is explained at https://github.com/blazegraph/database/wiki/HAJournalServer#Basic_Deployment, and a example with the Wikidata deployment of Blazegraph (with 3 nodes) can be found at https://wikitech.wikimedia.org/wiki/Nova_Resource:Wikidata-query/Documentation (the author of this post doesn\u0026rsquo;t take responsabilities for your failed attempts or disasters \u0026ndash; if you success, I will like to hear and lear how you have manage it 😄).\n\rStill, the stand-alone version Blazegraph is a really interesting option for working with an open source triple-store which can manage big data volumes while providing high performance and support for RDF, SPARQL 1.1 and Gremlin.\r\r\r  https://blazegraph.com \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://aws.amazon.com/neptune \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n https://cassandra.apache.org \u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","date":1598430388,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1598430388,"objectID":"5a6a67b99261a867f82e6cdc648fdd8f","permalink":"https://ga11u.github.io/post/blazegraph-scale-out/","publishdate":"2020-08-26T10:26:28+02:00","relpermalink":"/post/blazegraph-scale-out/","section":"post","summary":"Blazegraph1 is a high performance scale-out triple-store for big data which can support up to ~12.7B triples in a single machine (see previous post).

Nevertheless, Big Data cames with its known challanges like the need for systems that are able to scale-up and -out (vertical and horisontal scaling). Thus, semantic technologies and more precicely triple-stores which support RDF and SPARQL following the W3C and semantic web standards (i.e., the databases designed for storing knowledge graphs represented with triples in RDF and query them with SPARQL) must adapt and be redesigned to facilitate horisonal and vertical scaling.\nSo far, the scale-up seems to be solved with the large triple-stores\r[1] that can handle big data volumes by adding more resources. E.g., propiertary triple-stores like the Spatial and Graph features in Oracle Database1, the AnzoGraph DB2 and the AllegroGraph3 that can deal more than ~1T (1012) triples or open-source triple stores like the Virtuoso Open Source Edition4 (~58.58B = ~58.58x109), the Blazegraph5 (~12.7B) and the Jena TDB6 (~1.7B). As we can see, in terms of dealing with big data volumes, open-source solutions are behind of those propiertary or licensing alternatives.\nAre those numbers big enough?\nAccording to Orgacle\u0026rsquo;s white paper\r[2], 1T triples can represent:\n  1000 tweets for every one of the 1B Twitter users. 770 facts about every one of the 1.3B Facebook users. 400 metabolic readings for eachof the 2.5 Billion heart beats over an average human life time. 12 facts about every one of the 86B neurons in the human brain. 5 facts about every one of the 200B stars in the Milky Way Galaxy. 7 facts about every one of the 150B galaxies in the universe. 10 facts about each of the 107B people who ever lived.   On the other hand, when talking about scale-out solutions for large triple-stores we find that scale-out solutions are offered by most of the propiertary platforms or only in licensing versions like Virtuoso Enterprise Edition, with the exception of Blazegraph which is the only open source platform that offers scale-out.\nTo know more about Blazegraph scale-out possibilities, I recommend you to read the following post: \rScaling-out Blazegraph, is it possible?\r\rSo what? What can we do if we need to scale-out triple-stores and we want to use and support open-source projects?\nIf we don\u0026rsquo;t want to work with a propertary or licensing tripe-stores but still needing a scale-out configuration, then we have two options: (1) using some open source triple-store on top of a highly scalable database like Apache HBase7 or (2) we can use a graph database in combination with Gremlin. Both options have their pros and cons. Using a triple-store in combination with a highly scalable DB provides with the benefits of both platforms but the system maintenance and complexity is considerably increased. Whereas, while most of the graph databases do not support RDF, SPARQL, do not have reasoning or infering services and SPARQL quieres have to be translated to other query languages like Gremlin8 (although not all SPARQL queries can be transformed to Gremlin and Gremlin only supports SPARQL 1.0 and not 1.1), there is only one system to configure and maintain.\nExamples of such soultions are: the Jena+HBase triple-store which combines Apache Jena with Apache HBase to provide a scalable triple-store using RDF and SPARQL, Titan9 and JanusGraph10 graph databases that run on top of Apache HBase and Cassandra11 and suport Gremlin, or Neo4j12 and ArangoDB13 graph databases that also suport Gremlin.\n\nBibliography [1] W3C.
